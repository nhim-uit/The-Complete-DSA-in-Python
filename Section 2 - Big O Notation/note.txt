How to measure the codes using Big O

# Rule 1:
    Any assignment statements and if statements that are executed once
    regardless of the size of the problem
    Complexity: O(1)

# Rule 2:
    A simple 'for' loop from 0 to n (with no internal loops)
    Complexity: O(n)

# Rule 3:
    A nested loop of the same type takes quadratic time complexity
    Complexity: O(n^2)

# Rule 4:
    A loop, in which the controlling parameter is divided by two at each step
    O(log n)

# Rule 5:
    When dealing with multiple statements, just add them up
